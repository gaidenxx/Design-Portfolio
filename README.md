  Repository for Design UI/UX portfolio - wireframes and prototypes

# About me
  I am a passionate Front-end/Full-stack Developer and UI/UX Designer from Brazil, with a great knack for solving problems and creating innovative web projects. I’m always looking for opportunities to grow and improve my skills. 
  
  Below you can see some of my wireframe and prototype projects that have already been developed and delivered to users.

# Wireframes Figmajam
  A wireframe is a simple visual step outline of a webpage or app that I can use to shows the layout and structure before start the prototypes and to get all the main UX from users and technical points from team. It helps me plan where elements will go and how to make this feature work in a technical way.

# Prototypes Figma & AdobeXD
  A design prototype step is an interactive and visual model of the product after I've done with the wireframe step, that shows how it will look and work. It is used to test ideas, user flow, and functionality before final development.
